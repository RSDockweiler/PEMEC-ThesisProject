twoPhaseEulerIsothermal is the standard twoPhaseEulerFoam, but with the energy equation excluded. \\
porousV3  is the twoPhaseEulerFoam solver with enchanced two-phase porous treatment - requires inclusion of constant/porousProperties

The folder gridConv contains the simulations used for a grid convergence study.
The modelStudy contains a permeability study and a flow regime study.
